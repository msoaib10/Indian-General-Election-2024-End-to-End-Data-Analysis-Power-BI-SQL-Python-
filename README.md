The entire analysis was performed in SQL Server, including data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, and advanced queries.


## ⭐ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Added a new field: party_alliance

Classified each party into:

NDA

I.N.D.I.A

OTHER

Standardized party names and alliances
Ensured consistency in constituency and state data


## 📈 Exploratory & Advanced Analysis

### The project covers:

Total seats, state-wise seats, party-wise seats

Alliance-wise performance (NDA vs I.N.D.I.A vs Others)
